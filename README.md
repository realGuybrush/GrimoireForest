# GrimoireForest

Grimoire Forest.

It is the game about kids, who got trapped in the magical forest, created by the power of ancient book they found lying in a crypt.

(Everyone on the title are characters of the game.)

The goal of the game is to find the way to understand the book and negate it's power, so that kids could return home and prevent some mastermind, who orchestrated their arrival,  from destroying the Universe.

(Die but do.)

The Forest is filled with various monsters and traps, mostly of eldritch origin. Kids will have to use all the help they could find, their own skills and even dark magic, to defeat those monstrous foes.
